==== Authorization

You can configure the `BayeuxServer` object with an `org.cometd.bayeux.server.SecurityPolicy` object, which allows you to control various steps of the Bayeux protocol such as handshake, subscription, and publish.
By default, the `BayeuxServer` object has a default `SecurityPolicy`, that allows almost any operation.

The `org.cometd.bayeux.server.SecurityPolicy` interface has a default implementation in `org.cometd.server.DefaultSecurityPolicy`, that is useful as a base class to customize the `SecurityPolicy` (see xref:_java_server_authentication[the authentication section] for an example).

The `org.cometd.bayeux.server.SecurityPolicy` methods are:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/server/ServerAuthorizationDocs.java[tags=methods]
----

Those methods control whether a handshake, a channel creation, a subscription to a channel or a publish to a channel are to be authorized.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `SecurityPolicy` methods are invoked for ``ServerSession``s that correspond to both local clients and remote clients (see also xref:_concepts_sessions[the sessions section]).

Application code can determine whether a `ServerSession` corresponds to a local client by calling method `ServerSession.isLocalSession()`.

In almost all cases, local clients should be authorized because they are created on the server by the application (for example, by services â€“ see also xref:_java_server_services_inherited[the inherited services section]) and therefore are trusted clients.
====

The default implementation `org.cometd.server.DefaultSecurityPolicy`:

* Allows any handshake.
* Allows creation of a channel only from clients that performed a handshake, and only if the channel is not a meta channel.
* Allows subscriptions from clients that performed a handshake, but not if the channel is a meta channel.
* Allows publishes from clients that performed a handshake to any channel that is not a meta channel.

A typical custom `SecurityPolicy` may override the `canHandshake(...)` method to control authentication:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/server/ServerAuthorizationDocs.java[tags=custom]
----

To understand how to install your custom `SecurityPolicy` on the `BayeuxServer` object, see how it is done in xref:_java_server_authentication[the authentication section].

Follow also xref:_java_server_authorizers[the authorizers section] for further information about authorization.
