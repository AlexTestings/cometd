==== Disconnecting

Disconnecting is straightforward:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/client/ClientDisconnectDocs.java[tags=simpleDisconnect]
----
====

Like the other APIs, you can pass a callback `MessageListener` to be notified that the server received and processed the disconnect request:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/client/ClientDisconnectDocs.java[tags=callbackDisconnect]
----
====

Alternatively, you can block and wait for the disconnect to complete:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/client/ClientDisconnectDocs.java[tags=blockingDisconnect]
----
